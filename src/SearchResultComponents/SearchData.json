This was one among the several forts owned by the Ahmadnagar Sultanate. Along with the Harihar Fort, many other forts near Nashik like Trimbak, Tringalvadi, and a few other Poona (now Pune) forts were surrendered by Shahaji Bhosale to Khan Zaman in 1636.Today, the fort is exclusively used as a trekking site.

And that's how the mountain got its name. Along with the cave, believed to be the place where Lord Hanuman was born, there's Anajani Mata temple. A lot of other places associated with the life of Lord Hanuman are also there, which can be seen while trekking on the hill. One such place is a cave, which is believed to be the spot where Lord Pawan Dev took Bal Hanuman when he was hit by the 'vajra' of Lord Indra. Also, there is a Mata Anjana temple; the place where Goddess Anjani meditated for a kid, and Shiva ultimately appeared in front of her to bless a boon. There are two pindies inside the temple; the big one is of Mata Anjana and the small one is of Bal Hanuman. A cave decorated with inscriptions that are as old as 1000 years also appears while trekking on the hill.To reach the Anjaneri temple, you have to cross three mountains. When you cross the fort, you have already crossed the first mountain and came on second. Top of the second mountain is a plain area and you need to walk around 1 km to reach the Indra Sarovar Lake.",

During reign of Sambhaji, Aurangzeb came to Maharashtra with the motive to destroy Hindavi Swarajya completely. Nashik was under the command of Mughals. Since Ramshej is near Nashik, the Mughals thought it would be the easiest to conquer it but proved to be a hard nut to crack.To conquer this fort Aurangzeb sent Shahbuddin Gaziudin Firozejung with an army of 40,000 soldiers and canons. The Mughals sieged the fort when the fort had only 600 Mavalas. The first attack came from the Mughals to which the Mavalas replied by a massive stone attack. As a result of this attack, the Mughals had to back off. Afterwards Shahbuddin tightened the siege, dynamited the area and installed wooden platforms to hold the canons and many more ideas followed. The Killedar (commander) of Ramshej fort was an experienced and intelligent strategist and put an end to their daydreams. Shahbuddin’s obstinate desire to win made him think carefully. “He made a wooden bastion capable enough to accommodate 500 men and 50 canons. Accordingly the surrounding forest was cleared to construct a huge wooden bastion. The Mughals attempted attacks from the bastion, which failed eventually.",

This was because the gods had blessed him because of his steadfast devotion and regular prayers. The other rishis felt jealous of him and sent a cow into his fields.When Gautama tried to frighten the cow away from his fields, it died. For the sin of killing a cow, Gautama worshipped Lord Shiva to release the Ganga River and let her flow into his ashram to purify it. Pleased with his devotion, Lord Shiva released Ganga and told her to stay there. The Kushavarta or sacred pond that exists now is the source of the Godavari. (People worship the Godavari as Ganga.) The sage requested Lord Shiva also to make the site his abode, which the Lord did in the form of the jyotirlinga.",

Hop, skip and jump away from the iconic Ramkund, the temple is quite unusual because, like other Shiva shrine, there is no statue of Lord Nandi, the gatekeeper of Shiva. According to the legends, the temple was the place where Lord Shiva performed penance after taking a holy dip in Ramkund to wash off his sin. The reason why there's no Nandi statue in the temple is because Lord Shiva regarded Nandi as a Guru or teacher and hence, there is no Nandi to guard the Kapaleshwar Temple..",
